# Twitter Turkeys

Since Twitter doesn't let you search their historical data via their API for free, I had to manually search for every turkey weight (broken down into three possibilities, "x pound turkey," "x lb turkey," and "xlb turkey." That wasn't fun, but eventually I filled [turkey.csv](https://github.com/PerplexCity/TwitterTurkeys/blob/master/turkey.csv), which was easily fed into [turkey.R](https://github.com/PerplexCity/TwitterTurkeys/blob/master/turkey.R) to be graphed.
